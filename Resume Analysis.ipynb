    "1. Overall, treatment and control groups are well balanced for most of the features: gender, years of experience, number of previous jobs, and education variables; however, the level of computer skills between groups indeed varies.\n",
    "2. It is important to have balance because the only distinguishment between treatment and control groups has to be a response variable - in our case, this is race. Only in this ways, when we sees difference between two groups we could infer that the difference is \"caused\" by the \"race\" difference. As in our case, the only concern is \"computer skills\". Treatment group has a higher average computer skills when compared with control group. This indicates baseline difference between two group and could be problematic. If we see difference among outcome variable we can not infer that it is \"caused\" by race. And computer skills is a desired skills of employer, it could definetely impact employers' hiring decision. If the average call of treatment group is higher than control group, it could be caused by higher computer skills in treatment group as well as race. At that time, it is impossible for us to come to solid casual inference."

    "1. to exercise 7&9: \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. the result suggests that there might be less racial discrimination among candidates with college educational level (or more), but we are not sure. And from exercise 9 we know that our dataset doesn't reflect the true distribution of black adult American's educational level in real life. Our dataset overrepresents the college level candidates. So we could not generalize the analysis result to general population. If candidates with higher education do experience lower discrimination, on average the general population might experience higher discrimination than this dataset indicates since they should have much more lower educated population.\n",
    "2. to exercise 6: \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. from our model statistics, \"black\" candidates in our dataset have lower likelihood being called back compared with \"not black\" candidates. But from exercise 1, we knew that our treatment group and control group have baseline difference: their \"computer skills\" have significant difference. Since \"black\" candidates in our dataset are a collectio of highly educated population, it is understandable their computer skills are higher than control group. So it is unknown that the different of \"call\" among two groups is caused only by \"race\" or also other features."
